//integer operations in JavaScript

// addition +
const myVar = 2 + 2;

//subtraction -
const myVar2 = 55 - 10;

//multiplication *
const myVar3 = 7 * 8;

//division /
const myVar4 = 88 / 11;


/* 
increment (add 1) to a number 

put ++ at the end of the variable.

ex. 
i++;

which is equivalent to

i = i + 1;

*/

/* 
decrement (minus 1) to a number 

put -- at the end of the variable.

ex. 
i--;

which is equivalent to

i = i - 1;

*/


/* 
difference between an integer and a float:

a float is a number that has a decimal point.

float = 2.5
int = 3

ex.
myDecimal = 5.7;

*/


/* 
remainder operator (%):
gives the remainder of the division of two numbers

ex. 
5 % 2 = 1
% / 2 = 2 remainder = 1
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1

the remainder operator is used to check if a number is even or odd.
even numbers have a remainder of 0 and odd numbers have a remainder of 1

***
remainder is not the same as the modulus operator, 
it is similar but doesn't work correctly with negative numbers
***

*/

/* 
compound assignments:
operators that can do a mathematical operation and assignment in one step

for addition the operator is +=
also referred to as augmented addition

ex.
myVar = myVar + 5;
or you can use the += operator
let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5; (the same as myVar = myVar + 5)


for subtraction the operator is -=
also referred to as augmented subtraction

ex.
myVar = myVar - 5;
or you can use the -= operator
myVar -= 5;


for multiplication the operator is *=
also referred to as augmented multiplication

ex.
myVar = myVar * 5;
or you can use the *= operator;
myVar *= 5;


for division the operator is /=
also referred to as augmenred division

ex.
myVar = myVar / 5;
or you can use the /= operator
myVar /= 5;
