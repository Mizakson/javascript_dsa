/* 
assignment_operator

you can store a value in a variable using the assignment operator (=).
here is an example usage...

first declare a variable:
var myVar;

then assign a value to it:
myVar = 5;

*/

// another example declaring a variable (a) and assigning it the value 7
var a;
a = 7;

/* 
you can also use the assignment operator to assign the value of a variable
to another variable. 

here is an example...
var myVar;
myVar = 5;

declare the second variable
var myNum;

make myNum have the same value as myVar
myNum = myVar;

*/

// here is another example using the variable a from line 17.
var a;
a = 7;
var b;
b = a;

/* 
initializing variable with the assignment operator.

it is also possible to declare a variable and assign a value to it in one line of code.

here is an example...
var myVar = 0;

*/

// here is another example initializing the variable 'a' to the value 9
var a = 9;
