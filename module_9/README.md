# module_9

9th Module in FreeCodeCamp JavaScript DSA Certification.

This directory has my notes on intermediate algorithm scripting.

*** algorithms.js file notes explanations are not as in-depth as 
alogrithms_2.js ***

This is more challenging than the basic algorithms, my initial notes
in the first file might not be the most in-depth due to it being my
first attempts at solving moderately complex algorithm problems.

The main goal of this module is to hone my reasoning skills and 
learn how to think out solutions to problems into code, learning
how to think algorithmically.

Best,
