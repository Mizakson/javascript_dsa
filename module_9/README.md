# module_9

9th Module in FreeCodeCamp JavaScript DSA Certification.

This directory has my notes on intermediate algorithm scripting.

*** algorithms.js file notes explanations are not as in-depth as 
alogrithms_2.js ***

This is more challenging than the basic algorithms, my initial notes
in the first file might not be the most in-depth due to it being my
first attempts at solving moderately complex algorithm problems.

Best,
