// notes on OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

// -----------------------------

/* 

OOP:
an approach to software development,
using objects and classes to organize code and 
to describe things and what they do

*/

// -----------------------------

/* 
objects in JavaScript are used to model real-world objects,
giving them properties and behavior like physical objects 


*note
when calling an object by a specific property use this pseudocode

console.log(objName.propName);

*/

// -----------------------------

/* 
objects can have a special type of property called a method,
methods are properties that are functions

pseudocode

let obj1 = {
    prop1: val1,
    prop2: function() {
        function code here
    },
}

obj1.prop2()
