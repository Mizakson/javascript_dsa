Certificate #2 from FreeCodeCamp, JavaScript DSA (Data Structures + Algorithms).

For now, I am taking a break from FreeCodeCamp and will be focusing on more project-based learning
with The Odin Project. FreeCodeCamp has been a tremendous help in learning the basics of web development, and
I am really excited to dive into more project-based learning with The Odin Project.  

Best,
